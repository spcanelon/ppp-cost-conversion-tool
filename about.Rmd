# Resources

**Appendix J** (Classification of the World's Economies) of the 2017 International Comparison Program report released May 2020 (link 5 below) includes a classification of the world's economies into four categories: low income, lower middle income, higher middle income, and high income.

From least technical to most technical, these resources talk about **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** as a metric important to consider when assessing a nation's ability to purchase goods and services:
